      Basically, I had to recreate a communication app using JavaFX.
      From the very basics, I had to use SceneBuilder to create our graphical environment, then create the whole
      controller stack using callbacks. I then wrote a TCP server and client, and incorporated them in the client app.
      Even though we were guided through this project, only a few managed to finish it.

    <p class="marginauto">We also had to use git versioning, and the whole code is available to download on
      <a href="https://github.com/Akomry/sae302_applicom">GitHub</a>. I used the IntelliJ IDE.</p>

        My favorite project of the year, again. It was fun to develop such an app, and I was thrilled to finally code in
        Java and/or OOP.
