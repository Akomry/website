        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Computer stuff</h2>
        <p>
          Passionate about linux, its architecture, how it works, <em>i use arch btw</em>, and plan on someday make a LFS.
          I'm self-hosting game servers, this website and several other services through systemd units and containers.
          Maybe it's time to host a ptero install? Anyways.
          I'm coding in Java, sometimes (rarely) in JS/TS, scripting using bash.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Music stuff</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a beginner vocaloid producer, using FL Studio, SynthesizerV and some random knowledge I acquired on the internet.
          Also been self-taught bass and guitar for 3 years now, have random skills on piano when absolutely needed.
          Maybe one day i'll commit on learning drums and saxophone.
          Huge Kasane Teto fan, KAFU enjoyer, Ado follower, Gloryhammer headbanger, just to name a few.
          Maybe I should make a public playlist for you to check :think:

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Anime and manga stuff</h2>
        <p>
          Steins;Gate fan, NGNL-Zero's my fav animated film all-time, is there more to explain?
          Jokes apart, i'm not a HUGE anime watcher, but i'm still an anime enjoyer. Working at an anime association 'round home.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Video game stuff</h2>
        <p>
          I'm playing a bit too much roguelites I think- <br>
          Huge fan of Mateusz Skutnik's works, like Submachine (Legacy), Covert Front and Slice of Sea. If you like good ol'
          point and clicks, check that guy out, he's on those games since 2005. So yeah, I use to play a heck lot of flash games.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Art stuff</h2>
        <p>
          I'm drawing on paper and on photoshop sometimes when I'm bored (and maybe at work too). Check my instagram for more pics, but here,
          you can have some.

          <br>[Penser à inclure des photos !!]

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Telecom stuff</h2>
        <p>
          I'm studying telecommunications, so obviously I have some knowledge and interest about it.
          I'm planning on making guitar pedals (an overdrive one seems really easy to make, only take some LC filters)
          and maybe a modular MOOG synthesizer if I ever find motivation to build one.
          I know the basics about amplutide and frequency modulation, QAM, spectre analysis, fibre optics, electronics...
          And i hopefully plan to lean more :D
